## Python Setup, Virtual Environments & pip

Learn how to install Python, set up isolated environments using venv, and manage dependencies effectively with pip.
Understand how to use requirements.txt to share dependencies across projects and explore best practices for virtual environment usage in teams.

## Core Syntax, Data Types & Variables

Cover Python’s building blocks — variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
Work with strings, numbers, and booleans, perform type conversions, and use formatted strings (f-strings) for cleaner output.

## Control Flow & Looping Constructs

Understand conditional logic using if, elif, and else blocks.
Master looping techniques with for and while loops, break and continue, and learn comprehension syntax for clean, concise iterations.

## Data Structures

Explore Python’s core data containers: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
Learn indexing, slicing, mutability, and how to choose the right data structure for your use case.
Includes practical exercises like data aggregation, lookups, and nested structures.

## Functions, Modularization & Imports

Learn how to create reusable, testable code using functions.
Understand arguments, return values, scope, and lambda functions.
Organize your code into modules, use imports effectively, and structure your repo for maintainability.


## Decorators, Closures & Advanced Functions

Dive deeper into Python’s functional programming capabilities.
Understand closures and higher-order functions, then learn how to write and apply decorators for logging, performance tracking, and validation logic.

## Error Handling & File Operations

Learn to handle runtime issues gracefully using try, except, else, and finally.
Practice reading and writing files, using context managers (with), and working with formats like JSON and CSV.
Implement robust error reporting and file-handling logic.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Master Python’s OOP model — classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
Cover inheritance, encapsulation, composition, and dunder methods like __init__, __str__, and __repr__.
Learn how to design classes that model real-world systems cleanly.

## Logging & Configuration Management

Learn how to implement structured logging using Python’s built-in logging module.
Understand log levels, file rotation, and formatting, and how to externalize configuration using JSON, YAML, or .env files.
Introduce consistent app-level logging setups for production use.

## Code Quality & Linting

Adopt clean coding practices and enforce them with tools like pylint, flake8, and black.
Learn to interpret linting reports and fix common code quality issues.
Introduce type hints and static checking with mypy to improve readability and reliability.

## Collections & Useful Standard Libraries

Explore advanced data manipulation using the collections module (Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple).
Learn iteration and functional patterns using itertools, functools, and operator.
Understand how these utilities simplify common coding tasks in production systems.

## Working with APIs

Use the requests library to interact with REST APIs.
Understand HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), handle responses, timeouts, and errors.
Implement retry logic, JSON parsing, and integrate API calls into your application modules.

## Testing & Test Automation

Learn how to write and structure unit tests using pytest or unittest.
Understand assertions, mocking, fixtures, and test coverage.
Set up automated testing to ensure reliability and consistency across your codebase.

## Dependency & Package Management

Understand how Python packaging works and how to manage dependencies in a project.
Use pip and requirements.txt effectively, pin package versions, and explore pyproject.toml as a modern alternative.
Learn how to structure and publish reusable Python packages internally.

## FastAPI Project (End-to-End)

Bring everything together by building a small FastAPI application.
Create REST endpoints with Pydantic models, structured logging, and configuration files.
Integrate an external API, handle errors gracefully, and write tests for your routes.
End with a clean, production-style project layout ready for deployment with uvicorn.

## Coding using AI Assistants

Learn how to effectively partner with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot, GPT-based chat tools, and code analyzers) to accelerate development without sacrificing code quality or ownership.
